# The Retro Calculator

I made a pretty [retro calculator][3], courtesy of the Odin Project, the site where I learned how to code. 

I took me 7 days and a few all-nighters to complete this. 

Lesson I learned? That any problem can be solved. 

It doesn't matter if you don't know what to do when you start working on it. Just solve little logic and functionality problems here and there...

...and you can build a calculator.

Here was my design [inspiration][1]. Here was my functionality [inspiration] that I got from The Odin Project.[2].

Have fun!

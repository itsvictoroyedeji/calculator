# The Retro Calculator

I made a pretty [retro calculator][3], courtesy of the Odin Project -- the site where I learned how to code. I'm still learning on that platform so be patient with a brother!

I took me 7 days and a few all-nighters to pull this off. 

Lesson I learned? That any problem can be solved. 

It doesn't matter if you don't have a freakin' clue when you start working on things. Just solve little logic and functionality problems here and there...

...and you built yourself a calculator.

Here is my design [inspiration][1]. Here is a working calculator [inspiration][2] that I got from The Odin Project.

Have fun!
